You know that friend you go to whenever you need a script to do X, or to automate process such-and-such from A to Z? Or maybe YOU are that friend ;)

What is the GPT AI model? How can it help us in our jobs? Should we be afraid it might make us redundant minions? Spoiler alert: no.

GPT is not just ChatGPT or Bing Chat. We'll talk about how GPT powers many of the popular tools out there, commerial and open source. And we've cherry picked some of the best and coolest for you to help better your coding skills.

Come learn how to leverage GPT to
- write (better) PowerShell scripts with AI tools,
- help you use Graph API,
- Use AI to automate the mundane parts of coding, like refactor, document and write unit tests for code,
- show off to your (now depreciated) friends
