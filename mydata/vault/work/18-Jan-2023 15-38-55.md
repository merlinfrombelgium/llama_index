## Notes 

[[Sebastian]] project overview
[[Ajay]] is Virtualization-based Security and vTPM, Credential Guard... supported?
	[[Merlijn]] [[Prasad]] supported by MS but not implemented
	[Trusted launch for Azure VMs - Azure Virtual Machines | Microsoft Learn](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/trusted-launch)
	[Azure Virtual Desktop Support for Trusted Launch Virtual Machines - Microsoft Community Hub](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/azure-virtual-desktop-blog/azure-virtual-desktop-support-for-trusted-launch-virtual/ba-p/3053043)
[[Prasad]] Tamper control?
	
[[Serge]] are we ready for the go-live of AVD in terms of performance monitoring? Concerns that first onboarded users might have bad experience without us noticing.
	[[Christopher]] 
		we have App Insights, Log Analytics.
		Nerdio is still in pilot. No decision made on purchase, implementation.

[[Sebastian]] status on M-drive?
	[[Serge]] 
		M-drive is DFS-based.
		Probably need to whitelist all related netapp storage endpoints in all regions
		
[[Serge]] AVD should replicate the UCB laptop experience
	some backends are not accessible and need to be whitelisted > time consuming
	[[Jan]] from security perspective, this should be more straight-forward going forward since approvals
