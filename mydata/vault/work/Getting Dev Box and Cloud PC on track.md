## Preparation 
 
  Hello Dimitri and Michel,

As discussed between Dimitri and myself, letâ€™s discuss where I need help and how you can help, because I feel stuck.

Topics:

-   Dev Box implementation in DEV
-   Cloud PC license onboarding in DEV (see approval from Frederik Uyttersprot attached)
 
---- 
 
## Notes 
 
  1. Cloud PC
	  1. IAM can onboard the activation links in DEV
	  2. MyAccess needs to create two group(s) to assign licenses to
	  3. ==What budget to be used to charge? (cfr Seb/Ralph)
  2. Dev Box

	  2. communicate requirements
