## Preparation 
 
Dear all,

I have initiated the “entry into service” process which defines the service processes and what/how the service desk handles incoming AVD related services request. For this we will have to describe as many issues as possible in **KNOWLEDGE Base (KB) articles** to make the service desk able to resolve as many issues 1st line.

I would like to collect with you what basic questions, basic troubleshooting, etc. could be handled by service desk – and then create the necessary KB articles. 

May I ask you to prepare this meeting by brainstorming by yourself about the items/questions/etc.

remember that this should have 2 benefits: the user gets quicker resolution by the 1st line servicedesk. and 2: we as the AVD team have less stupid stuff to handle...  

In our meeting, we collect them and define the content for the KB articles

thank you in advance.
Sebastian

## Notes 
 
  - Service desk works based on KB articles
  - If not solved > raise to L2 (that's us)
  - Sebastian is working on a board to collect issues

> [!Question]
>   - Do we have a reference KB from other customers? (@Joeri?)
