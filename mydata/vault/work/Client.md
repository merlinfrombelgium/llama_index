## **How to install the preferred client for AVD on Windows 10/11**

UCB's preferred way of using AVD is from a Windows 10 or 11 machine. This provides the richest possible experience.

To connect to AVD, you need to install the Remote Desktop client for Windows on your device. The preferred client for AVD is the 64-bit MSI application, which offers better performance and security than other clients.

### Non-UCB machine
