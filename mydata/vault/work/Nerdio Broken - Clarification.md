  Dear Team,

We would like to clarify why our access to Nerdio is now broken.

## Notes 
 
  
 Why are permissions revoked in January 2023?
 - [[Michel]] agreement for Nerdio permissions on Graph (see attachments) in August 2022, but allowing write permissions (highlighted in below screenshots) was a mistake made by someone/somehow - not clear as current team was not involved at the time. ==These write permissions were never and will never be granted.==
 - Nerdio UK (Neil) apparently responded to questions, stating there was no way around these permissions
